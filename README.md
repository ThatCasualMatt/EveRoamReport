# Roam Report

A tool for generating reports for a fleet roam.

# Usage

Input:
 - The names of all pilots that flew in the roam
 - Start time of the roam
 - End time of the roam

The tool then generates a list of kills that those pilots participated in. You can then manually deselect kills you're not interested in.

Finally, generate an after action report template to be used in a phpBB forum.

Designed to be used within EVE University forums. Very much WIP.
